# Footer Formatting Fixes Report

## Issue Summary
The user reported that footer formatting and styling was broken after the security implementation and deep changes. The footers in both `app.html` and `press-release.html` were not displaying properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issues were:

1. **Missing CSS Variables**: The `press-release.html` file was missing essential CSS variables that the footer styles depend on
2. **Incomplete CSS Styles**: The footer styles were defined but missing supporting CSS variables
3. **Theme System Mismatch**: The `app.html` uses a theme system with `[data-theme="dark"]` and `[data-theme="light"]` selectors, but `press-release.html` doesn't have this system

## Specific Issues Found

### 1. Missing CSS Variables in press-release.html
The footer styles were using these CSS variables that weren't defined:
- `var(--card-bg-glass)`
- `var(--border-glass)`
- `var(--accent-color)`
- `var(--accent-color-light)`
- `var(--text-color)`
- `var(--text-muted-color)`

### 2. Incomplete Footer Styles
The footer styles were defined but missing the supporting CSS variables and some hover effects.

## Implemented Fixes

**Location**: `press-release.html` (lines 200-210)

:root {
    --card-bg-glass: rgba(24, 24, 27, 0.6);

    border-top: 1px solid var(--border-glass);
    margin-top: auto;
}

footer a {
    text-decoration: none;
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
}

footer a:hover {
    color: var(--accent-color) !important;
}
```
