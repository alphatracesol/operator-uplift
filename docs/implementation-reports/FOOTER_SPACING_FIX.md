# Footer Spacing Fix - Press Release Page

## Issue Identified
The user reported a small gap below the footer on the press release page that was pushing the footer up close to the edge of the "About Operator Uplift" section, creating improper spacing.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Complex footer positioning**: The footer was using `width: 100vw` with complex `left: 50%; right: 50%; margin-left: -50vw; margin-right: -50vw;` positioning which was creating gaps
2. **Insufficient spacing**: The About section had only `mb-8` (2rem) margin-bottom, which wasn't enough visual separation
3. **Layout structure**: The footer wasn't properly integrated into the page layout flow

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Footer Positioning Simplification
- **Removed complex positioning**: Eliminated the `width: 100vw` and complex margin/left/right positioning
- **Simplified approach**: Used `width: 100%` with `position: relative` and `left: 0; right: 0;`
- **Result**: Footer now spans full width without creating gaps

### 2. Enhanced Spacing Between About Section and Footer
- **Increased margin**: Changed About section from `mb-8` to `mb-16` (increased from 2rem to 4rem)
- **Better visual separation**: Provides more breathing room between content and footer

### 3. Improved Page Layout Structure
- **Body layout**: Added `min-height: 100vh`, `display: flex`, and `flex-direction: column` to body
- **HTML height**: Set `html { height: 100%; }` for proper viewport handling
- **Main content**: Added `flex-1` class to main content wrapper to take available space
- **Footer positioning**: Moved footer outside the main content container for proper layout flow

### 4. Mobile Responsive Updates
- **Simplified mobile footer**: Updated mobile CSS to use `width: 100%` instead of complex viewport width calculations
- **Consistent behavior**: Footer now behaves consistently across all screen sizes

## Technical Changes Made
