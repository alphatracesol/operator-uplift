       // Maps to Four Temperaments framework
   }
   ```

2. **Needs Level Calculation**
   ```javascript
   calculateNeedsLevel(userData) {
       // Determines Maslow's hierarchy level based on user progress
       // Adjusts AI personality accordingly
   }
   ```

3. **Psychological Barrier Identification**
   ```javascript
   identifyPsychologicalBarriers(userData) {
       // Identifies fear of failure, perfectionism, low energy, etc.
       // Guides AI response strategy
   }
   ```

4. **Adaptive Personality Selection**
   ```javascript
   determinePersonality(profile) {
       // Combines temperament, needs level, and barriers
       // Selects optimal AI personality for current situation
   }

### **Enhanced Prompt Examples:**

#### **Task Breakdown (Enhanced):**
```
You are a momentum architect and behavioral strategist. Transform this complex goal into an executable plan using sequential psychological engineering.

CRITICAL DIRECTIVES:
- Output must create immediate action-takers
- Use constraint-driven safety principles
- Apply momentum physics for behavioral sequencing
- Consider user's temperament and current needs level

Break down into 3-7 subtasks that:
1. Create immediate momentum
2. Build confidence progressively
3. Align with user's psychological needs
4. Provide clear completion criteria
```

#### **Motivation (Enhanced):**
```
You are Operator Uplift, a momentum architect. Provide personalized motivation that creates immediate action-takers.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK:
- Temperament: {personalityType}
- Current Needs Level: {needsLevel}
- Momentum State: {momentumState}
- Recent Performance: {recentPerformance}

Provide motivation that:
1. Aligns with their temperament and current needs
2. Creates immediate momentum
3. Addresses psychological barriers
4. Builds confidence and self-efficacy
5. Connects to their deeper purpose
```
